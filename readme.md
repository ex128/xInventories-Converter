# xInventories-Converter
xInventories was created in 2016 as a lightweight inventory management plugin for Minecraft server owners. It was sold for a while as a premium resource on [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/xinventories.657/) but is no longer undergoing active development.

xInventories-Converter (this repo) is a utility to convert Multiverse-Inventories data to a format that can be read by xInventories. I've uploaded the source here, but it's a disorganized nightmare. My apologies to anyone who is looking through this in the future. The dependencies (Google json and Mojang accounts API) should really be added using mvn or similar but the source just compiles along with xInventories-Converter atm.

I'm totally happy to accept PRs to refactor or to support additional inventory management plugins. I fear this would need a total rewrite to accommodate that, though. But feel free to give it a shot and add me (@ex128) as a reviewer!
